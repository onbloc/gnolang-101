## Introduction

Welcome to GNOLANG 101!

This course is designed for aspiring programmers who are looking to become a smart contract developer on Gnoland, a scalable layer 1 with built-in concurrency.

Existing smart contract platforms are struggling with mass adoption due to technical issues such as 1) low throughput, 2) non-interoperability, or 3) flawed tokenomics.

Gnoland addresses these problems with the highly performant Tendermint Consensus algorithm and Gnolang, a fork of Golang. This course focuses on Gnolang, the language that is used in the core modules of Gnoland and its dapps. Highlights of Gnolang as described in its official docs are as follows:

 - Like interpreted Go, but more ambitious.
 - Completely deterministic, for complete accountability.
 - Transactional persistence across data realms.
 - Designed for concurrent blockchain smart contracts systems. 

Gnolang is in its early stage, and therefore we're in need of passionate developers that can help us build the tools, applications, and modules to create a vibrant ecosystem centered around quality software.

This course consists of resources, tutorials, and guides that will help you get started on your journey as a Gnolang developer. By the end of the course, you will understand how to write and publish contracts on the Gnoland blockchain in Gnolang. If you ever run into any issues, reach out for help on [the Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3YbdqVP8Tb) where we have active developers willing to support newcomers!

**This course assumes that you have a moderate degree of programming skills.*
